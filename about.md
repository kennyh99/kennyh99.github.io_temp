# About Me

I'm a musician and engineer. My area of interest concerns the relationship between music and engineering; I aspire to be an inventor who can bring evolution to music technology and contribute to our daily lives. Music has informed my interpersonal intelligence, as an unexpected outcome of studying music has been my strong sense of cadence and voice, which I have often found helpful in reading people. I have learned to work with the resources at my disposal, seeing untapped potential in everyday objects. Picking out materials deliberately formulates with being aware of how multiple variables can influence intended outcomes. From my music and engineering experience, I have looked beyond the boundaries of my expectations and have seen meaningful work arise from different approaches. Music is the lens through which I will magnify my understanding of technology and its users today.
